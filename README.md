Objectives

The objective of the **Basic Calculator using Java** project is to develop a simple console-based application that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). It aims to enhance understanding of Java syntax, control structures, input/output handling, and error management, while improving problem-solving skills in program design and implementation.

Key Activities

*Project Setup:
   Set up the Java development environment (e.g., install JDK, configure an IDE like 
   Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA).
*Design the Calculator Logic:
   Plan how the calculator should handle input, perform calculations, and display 
   results.
   Define valid inputs (numbers, operators) and output formatting.
*Implement Arithmetic Operations:
   Write code to perform the four basic operations: addition, subtraction, 
   multiplication, and division.
   Ensure the calculator works correctly for various inputs, including negative numbers, 
   decimals, etc.
*Error Handling and Validation:
   Implement checks for invalid operators and handle division by zero cases.
   Provide meaningful error messages to the user.
*Testing and Debugging:
   Test the application with different inputs and edge cases.
   Debug any issues (like incorrect results or input errors).
*Enhancements (Optional):
   Add more advanced features like square root, exponentiation, memory storage (for 
   recalling previous results), etc.
   Convert the console-based version to a GUI-based calculator using Swing or JavaFX (if 
   desired).

Technologies Used

*Programming Language:
    Java: A widely-used, object-oriented programming language that forms the core of this 
          project.
*Development Environment:
    JDK (Java Development Kit): Required to compile and run Java programs.
    IDE (Integrated Development Environment): Tools like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or 
                                         NetBeans are commonly used for Java development.
*Libraries/Packages:
   java.util.Scanner: Used to capture user input from the console.
*Optional (for GUI version):
   Swing or JavaFX: Frameworks to build graphical user interfaces in Java, if you wish to 
                    extend the project into a GUI-based calculator.
